NextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.

  

Wait a second ... a "framework" for React? Isn't React itself already a framework for JavaScript?

  

Well ... first of all, React is a "library" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.

  

Not for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.

  

## Why would we then need NextJS?

  

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

  

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

  

- File-based Routing

- Built-in Page Pre-rendering

- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities

- Image Optimization

- Much More

 ## styledcomponents
	
**StyledComponents** is react library that solve some problem for styling the pages
	
- No ClassName need

- Secure styling that nobody can exposed

- Use js in css

- can use theme for application

- Much More
